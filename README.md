## Project Overview

This project applies network optimization algorithms to understand brain connectivity patterns that support learning and how mental health conditions disrupt these networks. Using a 90×90 functional connectivity matrix from resting-state fMRI, we implement:

- **Maximum flow analysis** to identify critical learning pathways
- **Centrality measures** (degree, betweenness, PageRank, closeness) to rank brain region importance
- **Mental health simulations** modeling depression, anxiety, and ADHD disruptions
- **Information spreading dynamics** to visualize attention propagation
- **Community detection** to discover functional brain systems

The complete implementation demonstrates network optimization concepts applied to a real-world neuroscience problem.

## Running the Analysis

### Complete Pipeline (Recommended)

Execute all analyses in sequence:

```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

**What this does**:
1. Loads 90×90 connectivity matrix and constructs weighted graph
2. Computes basic network statistics (density, clustering, path length)
3. Runs max-flow analysis for learning pathways (attention → memory)
4. Calculates centrality measures for all 90 brain regions
5. Simulates mental health disruptions (depression, anxiety, ADHD)
6. Models information spreading dynamics
7. Detects functional communities via modularity optimization
8. Generates all figures and exports numerical results

**Runtime**: ~10 minutes
**Output**: 4 figures + 6 data files in `results/`

### Individual Module Execution

Run specific analyses independently:

```bash
# Network exploration (density, clustering, visualizations)
python src/explore.py

# Learning pathways (max flow from attention to memory systems)
python src/learning_pathways.py

# Hub identification (centrality rankings)
python src/hub_analysis.py

# Mental health simulations
python src/mental_health_sim.py

# Attention spreading dynamics
python src/attention_dynamics.py

# Community detection
python src/functional_systems.py
```

**Note**: All modules can run independently; they each load data and save their own outputs.

## Code Architecture

### Module Responsibilities

#### `data_loader.py`
**Purpose**: Central data management and graph construction

**Key Functions**:
- `load_brain_network()` → Returns `BrainNetworkData` object
- `build_graph_from_matrix()` → Converts correlation matrix to NetworkX graph

**Graph Construction Logic**:
```python
# Edges are added only if |correlation| ≥ threshold (default 0.2)
# Edge weight = original signed correlation value
# Self-loops excluded
# Symmetry enforced: (i,j) weight = (j,i) weight
```

**Why symmetry enforcement?**
Correlation matrices should be symmetric, but numerical noise can create slight differences. We average each pair: `matrix = (matrix + matrix.T) / 2`

#### `explore.py`
**Purpose**: Basic network analysis and visualization

**Computed Metrics**:
- Density: fraction of possible edges present
- Average clustering coefficient
- Average shortest path length (on largest connected component)
- Degree distribution

**Generates**:
- Connectivity heatmap
- Degree distribution histogram
- Network overview with hubs highlighted

#### `learning_pathways.py`
**Purpose**: Max-flow/min-cut analysis

**Algorithm**: Edmonds-Karp (NetworkX implementation)

**Approach**:
1. Create super-source node connected to all attention regions
2. Create super-sink node connected from all memory regions
3. Run max-flow from super-source to super-sink
4. Result = maximum information capacity through attention→memory pathway

**Edge Capacities**: We use absolute correlation values as capacities (negative correlations become positive for flow purposes)

#### `hub_analysis.py`
**Purpose**: Centrality computations for all 90 regions

**Four Centrality Measures**:
1. **Degree**: `deg(v)` = number of neighbors
2. **Betweenness**: fraction of shortest paths passing through node
3. **Closeness**: `1 / Σ dist(v, u)` for all u
4. **PageRank**: Google's algorithm adapted to brain networks

**Interpretation**:
- High degree = highly connected hub
- High betweenness = critical bottleneck (removing it disconnects network)
- High closeness = efficiently reaches all other regions
- High PageRank = connected to other important regions

#### `mental_health_sim.py`
**Purpose**: Simulate connectivity disruptions

**Disruption Models** (based on neuroscience literature):

**Depression**:
```python
DMN internal connectivity *= 1.3        # Hyperactive rumination
Executive control *= 0.8                # Weakened cognitive control
DMN-Executive anticorrelation *= 1.1    # Reduced suppression
```

**Anxiety**:
```python
Salience network *= 1.3                 # Heightened threat detection
Salience-Attention edges *= 1.2         # Attention hijacked by threats
Executive control *= 0.85               # Reduced top-down regulation
```

**ADHD**:
```python
Executive control *= 0.7                # Severe executive dysfunction
Attention networks *= 0.7               # Poor attentional stability
DMN-Executive anticorrelation *= 1.1    # DMN intrudes during tasks
```

After applying disruptions, centralities are recomputed to measure impact.

#### `attention_dynamics.py`
**Purpose**: Simulate information spreading through the network

**Algorithm**:
- Start with seed regions (visual cortex)
- At each time step, activate neighbors across strong connections (threshold = 0.25)
- Track temporal sequence of activation
- Saves CSV with (time_step, region, system) entries

**Use Case**: Models how reading-related information propagates from visual cortex through attention systems to memory regions.

#### `functional_systems.py`
**Purpose**: Community detection via modularity optimization

**Algorithm**: Greedy modularity (Clauset-Newman-Moore)

**Modularity Q**: Measures quality of partition
- Q > 0.3 = significant community structure
- Q > 0.5 = strong community structure
- Our result: Q ≈ 0.06 (highly integrated network with weak modularity)

**Why low modularity?**
Brain networks, especially at rest, are highly integrated. The low modularity reflects dense inter-system connectivity rather than isolated clusters. This is consistent with neuroscience findings that cognitive functions require cross-system coordination.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### Issue: `pip: command not found`
**Solution**:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Windows
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Issue: `ERROR: externally-managed-environment` (macOS with Homebrew)
**Solution**: Use a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Why this happens**: Homebrew-managed Python prevents system-wide pip installations to avoid conflicts.

#### Issue: SSL Certificate Error (during `download_data.py`)
**Symptoms**: `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`

**Solution**: Already handled in `download_data.py`
```python
# Applied automatically on SSL errors
import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
```

If still failing, download manually:
1. Go to https://www.humanconnectome.org/
2. Download AAL atlas connectivity matrix
3. Place in `data/functional_connectivity_90x90.csv`

#### Issue: Import Error - `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'XXX'`
**Solution**:
```bash
# Reinstall specific missing library
pip install <library-name>

# Or reinstall all
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

### Runtime Issues

#### Issue: `FileNotFoundError: data/functional_connectivity_90x90.csv`
**Cause**: Data not downloaded yet

**Solution**:
```bash
python download_data.py
```

#### Issue: Script hangs during max-flow computation
**Cause**: Very large graphs can be slow

**Solution**: This should not occur with 90 nodes. If it does:
1. Check available RAM (need ~2 GB free)
2. Close other applications
3. If still hanging after 5 minutes, press Ctrl+C and restart

#### Issue: Figures not saving
**Cause**: `results/figures/` directory doesn't exist

**Solution**: Already handled in code
```python
# Each script creates directories if needed
out_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
```

If still failing, manually create:
```bash
mkdir -p results/figures results/data
```

### Performance Optimization

**Slow execution?** Try:
1. Reduce connectivity threshold in `data_loader.py`:
   ```python
   brain = load_brain_network(weight_threshold=0.3)  # Default is 0.2
   ```
   Higher threshold = fewer edges = faster computation

2. Skip expensive analyses:
   ```bash
   # Run only essential analyses
   python src/explore.py
   python src/hub_analysis.py
   ```

3. Use PyPy (alternative Python interpreter, faster for some operations):
   ```bash
   pypy3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   pypy3 src/main.py
   ```

## Dataset Information

### Source

**Development fMRI Dataset** (Richardson et al., 2018)
- Available through Nilearn library
- Part of Human Connectome Project initiative
- Resting-state fMRI from healthy adults

### Anatomical Atlas

**AAL (Automated Anatomical Labeling)**
- 90 cortical and subcortical regions
- Widely used standard in neuroimaging
- Reference: Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. (2002), NeuroImage

### Functional Systems

Regions are mapped to 9 functional systems based on neuroscience literature:

1. **Visual** (12 regions): Occipital cortex, calcarine, cuneus
2. **Somatomotor** (6 regions): Pre/postcentral gyrus, paracentral lobule
3. **Attention** (8 regions): Parietal cortex (superior, inferior, supramarginal, angular)
4. **ExecutiveControl** (6 regions): Dorsolateral/medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate
5. **DefaultMode** (2 regions): Posterior cingulate, medial prefrontal
6. **Memory** (6 regions): Hippocampus, parahippocampal, amygdala
7. **Salience** (4 regions): Insula, inferior frontal
8. **Language** (10 regions): Temporal cortex, Heschl's gyrus
9. **Subcortical** (36 regions): Thalamus, basal ganglia, other deep structures

### Connectivity Matrix Properties

- **Size**: 90 × 90 = 8,100 entries
- **Values**: Pearson correlations, range [-1, +1]
- **Symmetry**: Enforced (brain connectivity is bidirectional)
- **Diagonal**: All 1.0 (self-correlation)
- **Preprocessing**: Standardization, motion correction, physiological noise removal (done by nilearn)

### Graph Construction

From correlation matrix to graph:

```python
# Thresholding: only edges with |correlation| ≥ 0.2
# Why? Remove weak/spurious connections, focus on strong pathways
# Result: 3,346 edges out of 4,005 possible (83.5% density)

# Edge weights: Original signed correlation values
# Positive weight = co-activation (regions work together)
# Negative weight = anti-correlation (one active → other suppressed)
```

**High density interpretation**: Brain is highly integrated, not modular. Most regions communicate with most others, enabling flexible cognition.

**Result**: Distinguishes learning hubs from peripheral regions

**Graph Theory Connection**: Centralities, PageRank & HITS
- Degree centrality: Count connections
- Betweenness: Fraction of shortest paths through node

- Connected components

### Mental Health Disruption Modeling

Based on neuroscience literature documenting connectivity changes:

**Depression** ([Kaiser et al., 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25599391/)):
- DMN hyperconnectivity → rumination
- Reduced executive control → difficulty concentrating
- Weakened DMN-executive anticorrelation → DMN intrudes during tasks

**Anxiety** ([Paulus & Stein, 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17046034/)):
- Salience network hyperactivity → heightened threat detection
- Attention bias toward threats → reduced learning focus
- Executive dysfunction → poor emotion regulation

**ADHD** ([Castellanos et al., 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18629236/)):
- Executive/attention network deficits → poor sustained attention
- Reduced DMN suppression → mind wandering during tasks
- Reward system differences → motivation challenges

These disruptions are simulated by scaling edge weights, then measuring the impact on learning pathway capacity and hub centralities.
